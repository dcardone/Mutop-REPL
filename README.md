This is a modified version of a project completed during the Spring '23 course CMSC330: Organization of Programming Languages. This is a "mini" OCaml REPL that supports let bindings, arithmetic, booleans, and function definitions and calls.
To run, clone the repo and run the following in the top level directory:

```` dune build````


````bash mutop.sh````
